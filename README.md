# DHSI-ethical-dataviz

These are code snippets to accompany the course, Ethical Data Visualization: Taming Treacherous Data, by Christopher Church and Katherine Hepworth.

This course is taught at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI)

This course teaches participants how to use ethical visualization principles and practices to visualize treacherous, or culturally problematic, data. Such data includes racist historical documents, ideologically laden materials, culturally controversial texts, politically charged topics, gendered works, etc. Aimed at people who work with culturally sensitive datasets, and those who are interested in critical reflection on visualization practice, the course will combine hands-on activities and discussion. Participants will create data visualizations using R and instructor-provided stock code, and then interrogate their visualizations, identifying the extent and severity of the ethical pitfalls they inevitably contain. By the end of the week, participants will have produced several visualizations and prepared a position statement on ethical visualization appropriate for their own cultural and disciplinary contexts. No previous knowledge in coding, R, or visualizations is required. Participants are welcome to bring their own treacherous data, or they may use sample projects provided by the instructors. If you are unsure as to whether your data will work in this class, please feel welcome to contact the instructors in advance.
